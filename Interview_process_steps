üö©Ô∏è steps has been followed for performing Interview Analyzing

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Your Streamlit App
You ran the following command to start your Streamlit app on port 8551 and allowed it to be accessible from any IP (0.0.0.0):

streamlit run app.py --server.port 8551 --server.address 0.0.0.0

üîπ ü§îÔ∏è Why?

This makes your app listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0).
Without this, your app would only be accessible on your own machine.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Your Local IP Address
You checked your local IP address by running:

	hostname -I
üìå You found that your local IP is 192.168.29.198.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Expose the App to the Internet Using NGROK
You started Ngrok to create a public URL:

	ngrok http 192.168.29.198:8551  ( to start )

üîπ ü§îÔ∏è Why?

Ngrok creates a secure tunnel between your local Streamlit app and the internet.
It gives you a temporary public URL like:

	https://f3ca-2405-201-3025-503e-a15c-b14f-7ebb-d812.ngrok-free.app  (public url)


This URL allows anyone to access your app from anywhere.

Yes, if your laptop is closed, you change WiFi, or you face any errors, it will impact your colleagues who are using the app. Here's why:

üî¥ How These Issues Affect Access?
Laptop Closed or Shutdown

Your Streamlit app will stop running.
Ngrok session will disconnect.
Solution: Keep your laptop powered on with the app running.
WiFi Network Change

Your local IP address (192.168.29.198) may change.
Ngrok forwards traffic to your local IP, so if your IP changes, the tunnel breaks.
Solution: Restart Ngrok with your new IP:
bash
Copy
Edit
hostname -I  # Find your new IP
ngrok http <new-ip>:8551
Errors in Streamlit App

If your Streamlit app crashes, your colleagues won't be able to access the app.
Solution: Restart Streamlit:
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8551 --server.address 0.0.0.0
Ngrok Session Timeout (Free Plan)

Free Ngrok sessions reset every 2 hours or if you disconnect.
The public URL changes every time you restart Ngrok.
Solution: Share the new URL with colleagues every time it changes OR upgrade to a paid Ngrok plan to get a fixed URL.
‚úÖ How to Keep Your App Always Available?
To avoid interruptions, consider deploying your app on a cloud platform:

Deploy to a Cloud Server (Recommended)

AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean
Your app runs 24/7 without depending on your laptop.
Use a Free Cloud Service

Railway.app, Render.com, Hugging Face Spaces, Heroku (paid)
Provides a public, fixed URL.
Use a Raspberry Pi (If you have one)

If you want to self-host but keep it always running, use a Raspberry Pi instead of a laptop.
